\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem Background}
The Olympic medal table is a key focus for nations and fans, reflecting athletic success and national pride. Predicting medal counts, however, is challenging due to the complex factors involved, such as event types, host country advantages, and the emergence of new competitors. This problem requires developing models exclusively based on the provided datasets, including historical medal tables, event breakdowns, and athlete performance.

Traditional forecasting methods, like OLS regression and Poisson models, struggle with accuracy, particularly for countries with zero or few medals. This problem emphasizes predicting medal breakthroughs for such nations, which demands innovative approaches beyond historical trends.

Key aspects include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Exploring the relationship between events and medal distributions.
    \item Examining host country advantages and their influence on results.
    \item Assessing the impact of "great coaches" on medal performance, identifying sports where targeted investment in coaching could make a difference.
    \item Projecting medal counts for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, including prediction intervals, while addressing uncertainty and potential breakthroughs for nations without prior Olympic success.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Literature Review}

Predicting Olympic medal counts has been a topic of interest for researchers across various fields, including economics, sociology, and sports science. Early studies, such as those by Ball (1972) and Grimes et al. (1974), \cite{1} focused on identifying fundamental socioeconomic and demographic factors that influence a nation's medal count. These studies emphasized the importance of population size and economic resources in determining Olympic success. Subsequent research, including work by Bernard and Busse (2004) and Xun Bian (2005) \cite{2}, further explored the impact of political systems and hosting advantages on medal counts, finding that hosting the Games and having a centrally-planned economy can significantly enhance a country's performance.

Recent advancements in statistical and machine learning techniques have led to more sophisticated models for predicting Olympic medals. Schlembach et al. (2022) \cite{5} applied a two-staged Random Forest model, incorporating a wide range of socioeconomic variables, including GDP, population, and public health indicators. This approach outperformed traditional models and naïve forecasts, demonstrating the potential of machine learning to improve prediction accuracy. Similarly, Forrest et al. (2010) \cite{4} enhanced traditional regression-based models by including additional regressors such as public spending on recreation and the effects of future hosts. These studies highlight the importance of considering multiple factors, including public health crises like COVID-19, in predicting Olympic performance.

Despite significant progress, predicting Olympic medals remains a complex task due to the interplay of numerous factors. It's recommended that future research should focus on incorporating more granular data, such as individual athlete performance and training conditions, to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, the use of panel data and advanced machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and ensemble methods, could provide further insights into the determinants of Olympic success. It's also deemed important to address the exogeneity of the total number of medals available and considering cultural factors, such as political freedom and gender equality. Overall, the field has evolved from simple correlation-based models to sophisticated machine learning algorithms, with traditional socioeconomic factors remaining significant predictors of Olympic success.

\subsection{Our Work}

Due to the limitation of usable dataset, we cannot explore many of the aforementioned factors in detail. Instead, we focus on developing a model that predicts Olympic medal counts based on historical data and sport-specific information. Our model has the following features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A two-stage model that first predicts the number of medals won by each country in each sport, then aggregates these predictions to estimate the total medal count.
    \item Trains and evaluates multiple models with different underlying algorithms on the same dataset, and use the best-performing model for prediction.
    \item Separates different countries into multiple clusters based on their historical medal counts (in which their comprehensive national power is also embodied \cite{7}), allowing for more accurate predictions for countries with similar overall strengths.
    \item A sensitivity analysis that assesses the impact of different factors on medal counts and identifies key drivers of success. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Establishing the Model}

\section{Task1 --- Predicting Medal Counts for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics}
\subsection{Subtask1 --- Exploring the Relationship Between Event Count and Medal Count}
In this subtask, we investigate the relationship between the number and types of events a country participates in and the number of medals it earns. The analysis is performed using data from the 2024 Olympics, focusing on three primary aspects: visualization, correlation analysis, and interpretation of results.

\subsubsection{Visualization}
To better understand the relationship between event count and medal count, we employed two visualization methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scatter Plot}: A scatter plot was created to display the relationship between the number of events a country participates in (event count) and the number of medals it earns (medal count).  
    \item \textbf{Box Plot}: To further analyze the distribution of medal counts across different event count intervals, a box plot was used. This visualization captures the median, interquartile range (IQR), and outliers of medal counts for countries grouped into event count bins. The box plot reveals that countries with higher event participation tend to have a wider distribution of medal counts, suggesting greater variability.
\end{itemize}

        \caption{Visualizations: (Left) Scatter plot showing the correlation; (Right) Box plot depicting the distributions.}
    \end{figure}
    
    To better understand the relationship between event count and medal count, countries were grouped into five distinct tiers based on their competitive performance using the K-means clustering algorithm. This method allowed for the segmentation of countries into groups with similar competition characteristics, providing a more nuanced analysis of the underlying relationships.

    The decision to use K-means clustering was motivated by the scatter plot observations, which suggested heterogeneous patterns in the event count and medal count relationship across different types of countries. The clustering process was informed by previous medal achievements(first gold medals, then total medals), ensuring that the grouping reflected meaningful competitive distinctions.
    
    Once the countries were assigned to tiers, we conducted separate correlation analyses within each tier. This approach allowed for a targeted examination of the relationship between event count and medal count, accounting for the differences in competitive capabilities and strategies across tiers. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength and direction of the relationship, as it is well-suited for non-parametric data and can handle potential non-linearities.

\section{Task4 --- The Great Coach Effect: its identification and impact}

The Great Coach Effect is a phenomenon where the presence of a highly skilled coach significantly improves the performance of athletes. Due to the fact that coaches are not bound to a specific country, they can have a significant impact on the medal counts of multiple nations. Identifying the Great Coach Effect and quantifying its impact on medal counts is crucial for predicting Olympic success.

\subsection{Identification}

\subsubsection{Methodology}

We reckon that the Great Coach Effect can be identified by comparing the performance of athletes under the same coach across different countries. It should, by nature, cause one country to have a sharp increase in their medal count in specific sports (otherwise this coach wouldn't be that great), and one other country to go through a gradual-to-sharp decrease in their medal count in the same sports. This is because the coach basically can only focus on coaching one country simultaneously, and the athletes from the other country would not receive the same level of training and support.

Again, due to the inherent limitation of usable dataset, we can only seek to identify the Great Coach Effect from this characteristic, rather than other methods such as relying on coach information to deduce the effect.

Therefore, we propose a two-step approach to identify and quantify the Great Coach Effect:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify such pattern across the dataset.
    \item Refer to outside sources to interpret and cross-verify the result, finding out which specific coach is causing the effect each time.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Implementation}

We implemented the data filtering logic in Python with 0.23k LOC. The program reads the dataset, groups the data by country, sport, and year, and calculates the weighted medal count for each combination(gold medals with weight 3, silver with 2 and bronze with 1). It then uses linear regression on the most recent 12 years of data to calculate the slope of the medal trend over time. A positive slope exceeding a defined threshold (POS\_K\_LOWER) indicates a sharp increase, while a negative slope below another threshold (NEG\_K\_UPPER) indicates a gradual-to-sharp decrease. Countries with significant trends are recorded as having possible increases or decreases.

The program then pairs countries with overlapping trends in the same sport, checking the overlap period to ensure it spans at least four years and does not exceed a defined gap (OVERLAP\_GAP\_UPPER). Paired trends suggest the transfer of coaching expertise from one country to another.

By carefully calibrating the thresholds and gaps, we can effectively identify the Great Coach Effect and quantify its impact on national performances.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}

    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Potential occurences of The Great Coach Effects from sport level and event level}
\end{figure}

However elaborate we may calibrate the parameters, there still exists the issue of false positives and false negatives, with false positives accounting more because other factors may also contribute to this same characteristic. We recommend cross-referencing the results with external sources, such as coaching records and athlete interviews, to validate the findings and pinpoint the specific coaches responsible for these shifts. This data-driven approach allows for systematic identification of the Great Coach Effect, providing actionable insights into the strategic importance of coaching in achieving Olympic success.

\subsection{Quantification}

\subsubsection{Methodology}

We will quantify two main aspects of the Great Coach Effect: the magnitude of the performance change in both medal counts changes and the percentage of that change to the total medal count of the country.

The magnitude of the performance change can be calculated by comparing the average medal count before and after the coach transfer, while the percentage of the change can be calculated by dividing the change in medal count by the total medal count of the country in the respective sport.

These two aspects, especially the percentage of medal change to the total medal count of the country, have inextricable correlations with the overall strength of the country. Therefore, we will employ the same strategy as in our model establishment to cluster countries based on their historical medal counts, and then quantify the Great Coach Effect within each cluster.


\subsubsection{Implementation}

We further polish the program used in the identification step to calculate the magnitude and percentage of the Great Coach Effect, adding an additional 0.23k LOC. The program categorizes countries based on their tier value, calculates the average increase/decrease in medal count, and computes the average percentage of this change relative to the total medal count of the country. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the Great Coach Effect's potential impact on different countries and sports.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pics/coach_effect_impact_Sport.png}
    \caption{Quantification of The Great Coach Effect}
\end{figure}

This figure clearly shows the impact of the Great Coach Effect on different tiers of countries, highlighting the potential for significant performance improvements under the guidance of elite coaches. We can see that the positive and negative impact of the Great Coach Effect(namely, the moving in and out of great coaches) on absolute medal changes has remained constant among different tiers of countries, while its impact on relative medal changes decreases as the tier goes up. This is an expected phenomenon because countries with better overall power already do well in sports across a wide range of fields, so the arrival or departure of one specific coach won't have much effect relative to the total medal count. By quantifying the magnitude and percentage of the effect, we can better understand the strategic value of investing in high-caliber coaching talent and its implications for national Olympic success.




\subsection{Exemplification}
By analyzing the performance trends in specific sports, we identified notable cases where the transfer of a coach coincided with a sharp increase in performance of one country and a decline or stagnation for another, allowing for the cross-verification of our algorithms. Below are three exemplifications of the Great Coach Effect based on historical Olympic data and their correlations with our results.

\subsubsection{Synchronized Swimming Women's Team: Ana Tarré}
\begin{lstlisting}
- Event: Synchronized Swimming Women's Team, Overlap Years [2008-2012], Increase: CHN(slope=0.125) / Decrease: ESP(slope=-0.250)
\end{lstlisting}

This piece of data generated by the program reveals a significant overlap in performance trends between China (CHN) and Spain (ESP) during the period from 2008 to 2012. China's positive slope (0.125) and Spain's negative slope (-0.250) aligns well with Ana Tarré's transition from coaching Spain to China in 2012.

As we gather the data of a longer period, Ana Tarré's influence as a coach is clearly reflected in the medal trends for synchronized swimming. During her tenure with Spain (1996–2012), the team gradually improved, earning higher medals, peaking with a Silver medal in 2008 and a Bronze in 2012. However, after she transitioned to coaching China in 2012, Spain had dropped out of the podium positions since then until 2024, while China experienced a gradual rise, achieving a series of Silver medals and finnaly a Gold medal in 2024. This shift strongly aligns with the Great Coach Effect, as her expertise and strategies appear to have propelled China's team to the top while Spain struggled without her guidance.

\subsubsection{Gymnastics Women's Team All-Around: Béla Károlyi}
\begin{lstlisting}
- Event: Gymnastics Women's Team All-Around, Overlap Years [2000-2008], Increase: USA(slope=0.125) / Decrease: ROU(slope=-0.250)
\end{lstlisting}

According to the program data, the overlap period between Romania (ROU) and the United States (USA) spans from 2000 to 2008. During this time, Romania exhibited a steep negative slope (-0.250), whereas the United States showed a positive one (0.125), which matches the historical narrative of Béla Károlyi's influence.

Béla Károlyi's legendary coaching career demonstrates a clear pattern of the Great Coach Effect. While coaching Romania (1974–1981), he elevated the team to global prominence, culminating in Silver medals in 1976 and 1980. After moving to coach the United States (1981–2016), Romania's performance declined, while the U.S. women's gymnastics team emerged as a dominant force, securing multiple Gold medals, including in 1996, 2012, and 2016. The sharp contrast in medal trends between the two nations during and after his coaching periods highlights his pivotal role in shaping team success.

\subsubsection{Women's Volleyball: Lang Ping}
\begin{lstlisting}
- Event: Volleyball Women's Volleyball, Overlap Years [1992-2004], Increase: CHN(slope=0.175) / Decrease: USA(slope=-0.075)
- Event: Volleyball Women's Volleyball, Overlap Years [2004-2012], Increase: USA(slope=0.250) / Decrease: CHN(slope=-0.375)
\end{lstlisting}

The program identifies two overlapping periods: 1992-2004 and 2004-2012. In both periods, one of CHN/USA rises and the other falls, which closely corresponds to Lang Ping's coaching career.

Looking at Lang Ping's coaching career spanning over 20 years, we can also discover the distinct influence of a capable coach. During her first tenure with China (1995-2005), the team achieved notable successes, including a Gold medal in 2004. After transitioning to coach the U.S. team (2005-2013) which had won few medals in history, U.S. quickly surpassed China and won 2 consecutive Silver medals. When Lang Ping returned to coach China in 2013, the Chinese team quickly regained its dominance with a Gold in 2016. This fluctuation in performance underscores her unique ability to transform teams and highlights the strategic importance of securing top-tier coaching talent.

% These examples illustrate how the transfer of elite coaches can create significant shifts in medal performance across countries, substantiating the Great Coach Effect. The patterns not only validate the causality between coaching expertise and medal counts but also provide insights for national Olympic committees to consider investing in high-caliber coaching for sustained success.
\subsubsection{Cross Validation with Program-based Data}
- Event: Synchronized Swimming Women's Team, Overlap Years [2008-2012], Increase: CHN(slope=0.125) / Decrease: ESP(slope=-0.250)
- Event: Gymnastics Women's Team All-Around, Overlap Years [2000-2008], Increase: USA(slope=0.125) / Decrease: ROU(slope=-0.250)
- Event: Volleyball Women's Volleyball, Overlap Years [1992-2004], Increase: CHN(slope=0.175) / Decrease: USA(slope=-0.075)
- Event: Volleyball Women's Volleyball, Overlap Years [2004-2012], Increase: USA(slope=0.250) / Decrease: CHN(slope=-0.375)
